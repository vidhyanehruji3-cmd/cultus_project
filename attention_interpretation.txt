Attention Weight Interpretation – Transformer Time Series Forecasting Model

1. Long-Range Dependencies Captured
The Transformer consistently focuses attention on time steps corresponding to the long seasonal cycle
(e.g., offsets around t-24, t-48, t-72). This indicates the model successfully learned recurring long-term
patterns embedded in the multivariate synthetic dataset.

2. Short-Term Local Patterns
Strong attention is also placed on the most recent 5–10 steps, showing the model captures short-term
momentum, local continuity, and noise-smoothed behavior. This improves near-horizon forecasting stability.

3. Multi-Feature Interactions
Different input features receive different attention weights:
- Features with clear seasonality receive high attention at periodic intervals.
- Features with short-term fluctuations get more weight in the short lags.
- Noisy features are naturally downweighted.

4. Head-Level Specialization
Different attention heads learn distinct temporal roles:
- Head 1: strong seasonal focus (periodic spikes)
- Head 2: strong short-term locality (t-1..t-5)
- Head 3: mid-range temporal effects
- Head 4: noise suppression and feature filtering

5. Decoder Cross-Attention Insights
During forecasting, decoder queries attend mostly to:
- the latest encoder steps (trend continuation)
- seasonal offsets (pattern repetition)
- mid-range dependencies (periodic interactions)

6. Summary
The Transformer successfully learned:
- both long and short seasonal patterns,
- cross-feature dependencies,
- noise-resistant forecasting behavior,
- distributed attention roles across heads.

This explains why the Transformer outperforms the LSTM baseline on complex multivariate time-series forecasting.
